# Real-Time-Object-Detection-WebApp
This project is a real-time object detection system built with **Flask**, **OpenCV**, and **YOLOv3**. The application streams video from your webcam, detects objects using the YOLOv3 model, and displays the detections in the browser. It also provides a dynamic slider to adjust the confidence threshold for object detection.
